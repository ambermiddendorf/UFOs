# UFOs
### JavaScript - Module 11

## Overview of Project
The challenge is to filter the given UFO data by multiple criteria and display the results on the UFO Sightings webpage. The page is to load with all the data initially, then when a filter is changed the table will update.

## Results
The UFO data is filtered by Date, City, State, Country, & Shape based on user input. The updateFilter function triggers on each change of a filter. Each time a filter is changed the filters object is updated, the filteredData is updated, and the table on the page is rebuilt.


## Summary
With this new design there is no filter button. So, on each change the table is filtered. I preferred the button option, so you could put in all your filter requirements and then get a result without the filters triggering each time you entered a criteria. To further enhance these inputs, it would be very handy to have drop down menus that give the users options for their inputs.
